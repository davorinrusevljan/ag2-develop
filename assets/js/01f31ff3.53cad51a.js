While it's common to query LLMs to generate a plan purely through text output, we stress the importance of integrating symbolic computing to enhance general planning capabilities. By combining LLMs with symbolic planners and solvers, or guiding LLMs to generate code for planning, we enable them to address complex decision-making tasks for both real and virtual robots. This approach extends to various applications, including task and motion planning for drones and manipulators, travel itinerary planning, website agent design, and more."})]})}function g(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,i.a)(),...e.components};return n?(0,a.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},11151:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{Z:()=>s,a:()=>r});var a=t(67294);const i={},o=a.createContext(i);function r(e){const n=a.useContext(o);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function s(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:r(e.components),a.createElement(o.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
